# Hello, World!

This is my very first post written in **Markdown**. It's a simple and intuitive way to write for the web.

## Why Markdown?

* It's easy to read and write.
* It converts cleanly to HTML.
* It keeps your content separate from your site's design.

Here's a code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello from a Markdown file!");
```

And here is a quote:
