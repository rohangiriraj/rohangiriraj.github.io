# Data Pipeline Automation Tool

Python-based ETL pipeline for processing large datasets with automated monitoring and error handling.

## Overview

Scalable data processing solution handling 10M+ records daily with automated validation, monitoring, and failure recovery mechanisms.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Apache Airflow
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS S3
- **Monitoring**: Custom alerting system

## Architecture

### ETL Pipeline Design
The pipeline follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Extraction Layer**: Connects to multiple data sources
2. **Transformation Layer**: Data cleaning, validation, and enrichment
3. **Loading Layer**: Efficient bulk loading into target systems

### Scalability Features
- Horizontal scaling with Docker containers
- Queue-based task distribution
- Automatic resource allocation based on workload

## Key Features

### Automated Monitoring
- Real-time pipeline health monitoring
- Automatic alerting for failures or performance issues
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Dead letter queues for failed records
- Manual intervention workflows for complex issues

### Data Validation
- Schema validation at ingestion
- Data quality checks throughout the pipeline
- Anomaly detection for unexpected patterns

## Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: 10M+ records processed daily
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes for automatic recovery
- **Data Accuracy**: 99.95% with validation checks

## Development Challenges

### Scale Optimization
Optimizing the pipeline to handle increasing data volumes required implementing efficient batching strategies and parallel processing.

### Monitoring Complexity
Building comprehensive monitoring that provides actionable insights without overwhelming operators with false alarms.

### Data Quality Assurance
Implementing robust validation that catches data quality issues early while maintaining processing speed.

## Current Development

The project is currently in progress with the following upcoming features:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive analytics for pipeline optimization
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Extending beyond AWS to support hybrid cloud deployments
- **Advanced Visualization**: Real-time dashboards for pipeline monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Airflow DAGs
Custom DAGs designed for different data sources with configurable scheduling and dependencies.

### Docker Orchestration
Containerized components allow for easy deployment and scaling across different environments.

### AWS Integration
Leverages S3 for data lake storage and EC2 for compute resources with auto-scaling capabilities.
