#### Mathematical Formulations

The recommendation system uses several mathematical models:

**Collaborative Filtering Similarity**:
$$
sim(u,v) = \frac{\sum_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{ui} - \bar{r_u})(r_{vi} - \bar{r_v})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{ui} - \bar{r_u})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{vi} - \bar{r_v})^2}}
$$

**Neural Collaborative Filtering Loss Function**:
$$
L = -\sum_{(u,i,j) \in D_s} \ln \sigma(\hat{y}_{ui} - \hat{y}_{uj}) + \lambda \|\Theta\|^2
$$

Where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $\Theta$ represents all model parameters.

**NDCG@K Calculation**:
$$
NDCG@K = \frac{DCG@K}{IDCG@K} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K} \frac{2^{rel_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)}}{\sum_{i=1}^{|REL|} \frac{2^{rel_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)}}
$$
